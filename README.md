# WeatherApp


Weather app is a simple web application where you can search for the weather of all cities through an API.
In this application we can save our favorite cities in our database.

Every time the main page is loaded, all the cities that we have saved in the database will be displayed. On the other hand, if we no longer want a specific city to be shown, we can eliminate it from our cities.


To develop this application on the frontend we use HTML / CSS / JS and for the backend we use Node.js MongoDB.
